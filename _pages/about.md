Hi, I am Hendrik. I enjoy learning, teaching, bringing people together, and activities that rewards problem solving and creativity -- like programming. I study [Visual Computing at the University of Koblenz](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en/campus-koblenz/fb4/icv?set_language=en).

Usually I write code in `C/C++` or `python`. I am most experienced with `computer graphics`,  `gpu programming` and scientific `simulation` and `visualization`. I have also worked with embedded systems and microcontrollers, UI and websites. Check out the [projects](projects) section for a selection of my public projects. Many other programming languages have crossed my path and I am quick to try a new tool for a project, as the basic skills of programming and software engineering carry over well.

Before studying Visual Computing I worked in video production, where I have accuired some skills in `graphics design`, `photograpy` and `videography`. I am happy to offer those alongside my programming work.

Other interests of mine are `cooking`,  `electronics`,  `photography`,  `reading`,  `writing`,  `art`,  `games` and `sailing`. About some of which you might be able to read more in the different sections of this website or [blog](blog) (when I get around to write something).
