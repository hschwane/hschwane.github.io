Hi, I am Hendrik. I enjoy learning, teaching and activities that rewards problem solving and creativity -- like programming. Currently I study [Visual Computing at the University of Koblenz](https://www.uni-koblenz-landau.de/en/campus-koblenz/fb4/icv?set_language=en).

Usually, I code in `C/C++` or `python`. I am most experienced with computer graphics, gpu programming and scientific simulation and visualization.   

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
