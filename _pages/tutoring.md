[German below](#german)

Programming is fun. Programming together is even better. 
You are new to programming and want to kickstart learning? 
You learn computer science in school or university and want to boost your grades?    
You want some guidance getting into advanced topics, like computer graphics, gpu programming or simulation?  
As your tutor I will make sure you reach your learning goals as fast as possible. During sessions you have my knowledge at your disposal. I can answer questions, teach new techniques, review your code, or whatever else you need grow. Programming is best learnt by programming. Together we will find projects to work on, that match your skill level and help you improve. I can also provide you with additional learning materials to study on your own.     

If you are interested in tutoring, send me an [email](mailto:{{ site.email }}). Please include your current skills, learning goals and the desired time and day (I am in CET timezone).
