The mpUtils library is a collection of utility classes and functions I have used in many of my projects. 
It runs on Linux and Windows and integrates with OpenGL and [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) to create graphical applications. 
A game-engine-like API to simplify the creation of interactive graphics is work in progress. It can also be used together with CUDA and 
provides a few helpers such as simplifed interoperability with the OpenGL parts of the aplpication.

The next release is planned to use the MIT license and support C++17. 
A CMAKE based build process and minimal external dependencies allow for easy compillation. 
Many of the functions and classes provided by the library are independent and can be used on their own in other projects, 
without including the entire library. A [list of features](https://github.com/hschwane/mpUtils#features) can be found on the github page.
