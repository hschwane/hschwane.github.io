GraSPH2 is the successor of my interactive star formation simulation [GraSPH](/projects/GraSPH). It is designed more flexible and uses CUDA instead of OpenGL compute shader, which allows it to run on HPC systems. In addition to the real time visualization data can now be stored in files and reloaded.
