GraSPH2 is the successor of my interactive star formation simulation [GraSPH](/projects/GraSPH). It uses CUDA instead of OpenGL compute shader, which allows it to run on HPC systems. The physical model was extended to handle solid bodies and is now designed much more flexible to allow for future changes. It can be used for all kinds of particle simulations that require a n-body component. 

The interactive visualization has been reworked and can now display particles as 3D spheres as well as points. It shows particle properties using different color maps and features a build in UI to customize the visualization settings. In addition to the real time visualization, data can now be stored in files to analyze, view or continue the simulation at a later time.  

The projects pdf documentation, which explains the physical model, implementation on the GPU and results of first tests, can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/schwanekampAndKraft2020PlanetFormation.pdf). While it might be formatted like a research paper, it was not peer reviewed and published in the traditional way. It is merly a project documentation and should be treated as such.
